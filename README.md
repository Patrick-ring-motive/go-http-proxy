# go-http-proxy

This is my first ever project in Go! 
I find creating a reverse proxy to be the best way to learn a new language after you have a few under your belt already.
This proxy is pointed at the golang official docs.
You can view the results here:

I require some sort of modification to the original site and to include routing for all of the subdomains linked from the home page.
I also tried to emulate the async/await promise structure using goroutines. I did acheive it to some extent but I am definitely not done iterating over those structures.
